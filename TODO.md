# Planed work

- support autochange links on file renames (maybe for heading renames too)
- support link check report for all the files in the workspace
- check fs links using case-sensitive comparison even on Windows (like in Linux)
- check link references for existence
- custom regex rules (including exclude)
- suggestions for incorrect heading links
