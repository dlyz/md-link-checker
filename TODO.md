# Planed work

- code action to extract link as a ref at the end of file
- support link check report for all the files in the workspace
- support autochange links on file renames (maybe for heading renames too, but it is much harder)
- check fs links using case-sensitive comparison even on Windows (like in Linux)
- custom regex rules (including exclude)
- suggestions for incorrect heading links
